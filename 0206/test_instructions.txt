    Execute the command " iperf.exe – c  <IP address of the server>   -P 10  -w 1000k "

               (  -P refers to the number of parallel TCP streams and –w referes to the TCP window size  )

    - SKW77 - Router
    - LM843 - Router
- Approximate range and throughput for each wifi component to another of the same component
    - SKW77 - SKW77
    - LM843 - LM843

Iperf commands:

Bidirectional throughput

iPerf3 -s

Specified port
`iPerf3 -s -p 7575`

Specify server
`iPerf3 -c 10.10.10.1 -p 7575`

Runs 20 seconds by default, then outputs results, average throughput for the run

`watch -n1 iwconfig`

wavemon

Signal level

70 dBm to -85 dBm	Good	Strong signal with good data speeds
-86 dBm to -100 dBm	Fair	Fair but useful, fast and reliable data speeds may be attained, but marginal data with drop-outs is possible
< -100 dBm	Poor	Performance will drop drastically
-110 dBm	No signal	Disconnection
